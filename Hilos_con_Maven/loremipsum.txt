Wait right here
I'll be back in the morning
I know that I'm not that important to you
But to me, girl, you're so much more than gorgeous
So much more than perfect
Right now I know that I'm not really worth it
If you give me time, I could work on it
Give me some time while I work on it
Losin' your patience, and, girl, I don't blame you
The Earth's in rotation, you're waiting for me
Look at my face when I fuck on your waist
'Cause we only have one conversation a week
